## Project Summary
Our project is a data centric web application that scrapes and aggregates data from popular US grocers in order to provide users with useful  on-demand information on the current inventory, best prices, etc. The project will utilize a relational database schema such as MySQL to store relevant information on both grocers and their products. 
The front end will include an interactive interface that allows users to query for their desired information. We will implement a search bar and filter function that will send HTTP requests to the web server which will in turn retrieve the relevant data from the back end relational database. There will also be a place for users to manually add/delete their own data.
